Customer Management System

Steps to set-up in your system: (GIYHD - "Google if you have doubts")
1) Make sure you have git installed in your systems. (We are using Windows for development, your wish whatever you use but download accordingly)
2) Choose a location on your system where you would want to have the project folder then clone it folder there using "git clone" command on command prompt. GIYHD
3) After it gets downloaded there, 'cd' into the folder and initialise git using 'git init'
4) Make a new branch using 'git checkout -b new_branch" and make your changes in the code.
5) After changes are done, send a pull request. Spriha and Esakki are the maintainers, we will review and pull it into the code. GIYHD


Basically the workflow is like this:

                                                     ----------- Customer Login Page ----------------------------------
                                                     |                                                                |
                      ---- Customer Options page -----                                                                 ------ Customer Profile Page
                     |                               |                                                                |
      Allloginpage----                               --------CustomerRegistrationPage----CustomerPasswordChangePage----
                     |
                     ----- Manager Login Page ------- Manager View Details Page
